# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
To detect the presence of heart disease given the medical history of patient using Naive Bayes Classifier

Implementation of a Naïve Bayes classifier from first principles and evaluation on the dataset available from UCI. 
Comparison is made with Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier of sklearn library. 
I have used 5 random partitions of training and testing dataset to evaluate the implementation and results are given for each partition.
The following outputs are shown:
1. Confusion matrix
2. F1 score
3. ROC curve

Dataset for evaluating Naïve Bayes classifier: Heart Disease Data Set, available from:
